[![bb built-in](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/logo/built-in-badge.svg)](https://babashka.org)

Clojure library for shelling out / spawning subprocesses.

## API

In 90% of the use cases you will probably need `shell` and for the remaining use
cases you will probably need a combination of `process` and `check`. Start
reading the docs for those, skim over the rest and revisit the remaining functions when you need them.

See [API docs](API.md) as generated by quickdoc.

## Installation

This library is included in [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
since
[0.2.3](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v023-2020-10-21)
but is also intended as a JVM library:

``` clojure
$ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {babashka/process {:mvn/version "0.3.11"}}}'

user=> (require '[clojure.string :as str])
nil
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [shell sh process check]])
nil
user=> (shell "ls -la")
total 144
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff    704 Dec  4 13:39 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 75 borkdude  staff   2400 Dec  3 14:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  4 borkdude  staff    128 Mar 10  2022 .circleci
drwxr-xr-x@  5 borkdude  staff    160 Mar 10  2022 .clj-kondo
drwxr-xr-x@ 50 borkdude  staff   1600 Dec  3 20:55 .cpcache
...
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 136776"
```

## Usage

``` clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [process check sh pipeline pb]])
```

### shell

Most commonly you will use `shell`. It executes a command and streams the output
to stdout and stderr while the process is running:

``` clojure
user=> (shell "ls -la")
total 144
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff    704 Dec  4 13:39 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 75 borkdude  staff   2400 Dec  3 14:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  4 borkdude  staff    128 Mar 10  2022 .circleci
drwxr-xr-x@  5 borkdude  staff    160 Mar 10  2022 .clj-kondo
drwxr-xr-x@ 50 borkdude  staff   1600 Dec  3 20:55 .cpcache
```

The first string argument to `shell` is tokenized automatically: `"ls -la"` is
broken up into `"ls"` and `"-la"`. You can provide more arguments if you need to:

``` clojure
user=> (shell "ls -la" "src" "test")
src:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@  3 borkdude  staff   96 Mar 10  2022 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff  704 Dec  4 14:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  4 borkdude  staff  128 Dec  4 14:01 babashka

test:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@  3 borkdude  staff   96 Mar 10  2022 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff  704 Dec  4 14:13 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  3 borkdude  staff   96 Dec  4 14:01 babashka
```

This is particularly handy when you want to supply commands coming from the command line:

``` clojure
(apply shell "-ls -la" *command-line-args*)
```

The `shell` function checks the exit code and throws if it is non-zero:

``` clojure
user=> (shell "ls nothing")
ls: nothing: No such file or directory
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at babashka.process/check (process.cljc:113).
```

To avoid throwing, you can use `:continue true`. You will still see the error
being printed to stderr, but no exception will be thrown. That is convenient
when you want to handle the `:exit` code yourself:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:continue true} "ls nothing") :exit)
ls: nothing: No such file or directory
1
```

To collect output as a `:string`, use the `:out :string` option as the first argument:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 144"
```

To change the working directory, use the `:dir` option:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string :dir "src/babashka"} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 48"
```

To add environment variables, use `:extra-env`:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string :extra-env {"FOO" "BAR"}} "bb -e '(System/getenv \"FOO\")'") :out print)
"BAR"
```

### process

The `shell` function is a combination of `process` and `deref` and `check`. The
`process` function is the lower level function of this library that doesn't make
any opiniated choices:

- It does not provide a default for `:out`, `:in` and `:err`: in `shell` these
  default to `:inherit` which means: read and write from and to the console. In
  `process` they default to the default of `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`.
- It does not wait until the process completes.
- It does not check the exit code and throw an exception.

Use `process` when you need to change one of the above and `shell`'s options do
not support it. In practice this means: whenever you need async processing,
e.g. reading output from a process while it is running.

The return value of `process` implements `clojure.lang.IDeref`. When
dereferenced, it will wait for the process to finish and will add the `:exit` value.

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process "ls foo") deref :exit)
1
```

The function `check` takes a process, waits for it to finish (so you can omit
`deref`) and returns it. When the exit code is non-zero, it will throw.

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process {:out :string} "ls") check :out str/split-lines first)
"API.md"
user=> (-> (process {:out :string} "ls foo") check :out str/split-lines first)
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at babashka.process/check (process.clj:74).
ls: foo: No such file or directory
```

Both `:in`, `:out` may contain objects that are compatible with `clojure.java.io/copy`:

``` clojure
user=> (with-out-str (check (process {:in "foo" :out *out*} "cat")))
"foo"

user=> (->> (with-out-str (check (process {:out *out*} "ls"))) str/split-lines (take 2))
("API.md" "CHANGELOG.md")
```

The `:out` option also supports `:string`. You will need to `deref` the process
in order for the string to be there, since the output can't be finalized if the
process hasn't finished running:

``` clojure
user=> (-> @(process {:out :string} "ls") :out str/split-lines first)
"API.md"
```

## Piping output

Both `shell` and `process` support piping output from one process to the next
using but note that `shell` writes the output to the system's stdout by
default, so you have to provide it with `{:out :string}` for the next process to
capture the input, while `process` uses the default `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`
setting which defaults to writing to a stream:

``` clojure
user=> (let [stream (-> (process "ls") :out)]
         @(process {:in stream
                    :out :inherit} "cat")
         nil)
API.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
README.md
...
```

Forwarding the output of a process as the input of another process can also be done with thread-first (`->`):

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process "ls")
           (process {:out :string} "grep README") deref :out)
"README.md\n"
```

## Redirecting output to a file

To write to a file use `:out :write` and set `:out-file` to a file:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
nil
user=> (do @(process {:out :write :out-file (io/file "/tmp/out.txt")} "ls") nil)
nil
user=> (slurp "/tmp/out.txt")
"CHANGELOG.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md..."
```

or simply:

``` clojure
(do (shell {:out "/tmp/out.txt"} "ls") nil)
```

To append to a file, use `:out :append`:

``` clojure
user=> (do @(process {:out :append :out-file (io/file "/tmp/out.txt")} "ls") nil)
nil
user=> (slurp "/tmp/out.txt")
"CHANGELOG.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md..."
```

## Feeding input

Here is an example of a `cat` process to which we send input while the process
is running, then close stdin and read the output of cat afterwards:

``` clojure
(ns cat-demo
  (:require [babashka.process :refer [process alive?]]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(def catp (process "cat"))

(alive? catp) ;; true

(def stdin (io/writer (:in catp)))

(binding [*out* stdin]
  (println "hello"))

(.close stdin)

(slurp (:out catp)) ;; "hello\n"

(:exit @catp) ;; 0

(alive? catp) ;; false
```

## Processing output

Here is an example where we read the output of `yes` line by line and print it ourselves:

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :as p :refer [process destroy-tree]]
         '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(def yesp (process
           {:err :inherit
            :shutdown destroy-tree}
           "yes"))

;; Beware: infinite loop reading lines of "y" from the `yes` process:

(with-open [rdr (io/reader (:out yesp))]
  (binding [*in* rdr]
    (loop []
      (let [line (read-line)]
        (println :line line))
      (recur))))
```

## Printing command

The `:pre-start-fn` option can be used to report commands being run:

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :refer [process]])

(doseq [file ["LICENSE" "CHANGELOG.md"]]
  (-> (process
        {:out :string
         :pre-start-fn #(apply println "Running" (:cmd %))}
        "head" "-1" file)
      deref :out println))

## sh

`sh` is a convenience function around `process` which sets `:out` and `:err` to
`:string` and blocks automatically, similar to `clojure.java.shell/sh`:

``` clojure
user=> (def config {:output {:format :edn}})
#'user/config
user=> (-> (sh ["clj-kondo" "--lint" "src"]) :out slurp edn/read-string)
{:findings [], :summary {:error 0, :warning 0, :info 0, :type :summary, :duration 34}}
```

## Tokenization

All of `shell`, `process` and `sh` support tokenization on the first string argument using `tokenize`:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [sh tokenize]])
nil
user=> (tokenize "hello there")
["hello" "there"]
user=> (-> (sh "echo hello there") :out)
"hello there\n"
```

``` clojure
user=> (-> (sh {:in "(inc)"} "clj-kondo --lint -") :out)
"<stdin>:1:1: error: clojure.core/inc is called with 0 args but expects 1\nlinting took 10ms, errors: 1, warnings: 0\n"
```

## Output buffering

Note that `check` will wait for the process to end in order to check the exit
code. When the process has lots of data to write to stdout, it is recommended to
add an explicit `:out` option to prevent deadlock due to buffering. This example
will deadlock because the process is buffering the output stream but it's not
being consumed, so the process won't be able to finish:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process {:in (apply str (repeat 1000000 "hello\n"))} "cat") check :out count)
```

The way to deal with this is providing an explicit `:out` option so the process
can finish writing its output:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process {:out :string :in (apply str (repeat 1000000 "hello\n"))} "cat") check :out count)
6000000
```

## Add Environment

The `:env` option replaces your entire environment with the provided map. To add environment variables you can use `:extra-env` instead:

```clojure
:extra-env {"FOO" "BAR"}
```

> **Windows TIP**: Unlike in the CMD and Powershell shells, environment variable names are case sensitive for `:extra-env`.
For example, `"PATH"` will not update the value of `"Path"` on Windows.
Here's an [example of a babashka task](https://github.com/babashka/fs/blob/3b8010d1a0db166771ac7f47573ea09ed45abe33/bb.edn#L10-L11) that understands this nuance.

## Pipelines

The `pipeline` function returns a
[`sequential`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/sequential?)
of processes from a process that was created with `->` or by passing multiple
objects created with `pb`:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [pipeline pb process check]])
nil
user=> (mapv :cmd (pipeline (-> (process "ls") (process "ls"))))
[["ls"] ["cat"]]
user=> (mapv :cmd (pipeline (pb "ls") (pb "cat")))
[["ls"] ["cat"]]
```

To obtain the right-most process from the pipeline, use `last` (or `peek`):

``` clojure
user=> (-> (pipeline (pb "ls") (pb "cat")) last :out slurp)
"LICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nsrc\ntest\n..."
```

Calling `pipeline` on the right-most process returns the pipeline:

``` clojure
user=> (def p (pipeline (pb "ls") (pb "cat")))
#'user/p
user=> (= p (pipeline (last p)))
true
```

To check an entire pipeline for non-zero exit codes, you can use:

``` clojure
user=> (run! check (pipeline (pb "ls foo") (pb "cat")))
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at babashka.process/check (process.clj:37).
ls: foo: No such file or directory
```

Although you can create pipelines with `->`, for some applications it may be
preferable to create a pipeline with `pipeline` which defers to
`ProcessBuilder/startPipeline`. In the following case it takes a long time
before you would see any output due to buffering.

``` clojure
(future
  (loop []
    (spit "log.txt" (str (rand-int 10) "\n") :append true)
    (Thread/sleep 10)
    (recur)))

(-> (process "tail" "-f" "log.txt")
    (process "cat")
    (process {:out :inherit} "grep "5"))
```

The solution then it to use `pipeline` + `pb`:

``` clojure
(pipeline (pb "tail" "-f" "log.txt")
          (pb "cat")
          (pb {:out :inherit} "grep" "5"))
```

The varargs arity of `pipeline` is only available in JDK9 or higher due to the
availability of `ProcessBuilder/startPipeline`. If you are on JDK8 or lower, the
following solution that reads the output of `tail` line by line may work for
you:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
nil

(def tail (process {:err :inherit} "tail" "-f" "log.txt"))

(def cat-and-grep
  (-> (process {:err :inherit} "cat")
      (process {:out :inherit
                :err :inherit} "grep 5")))

(binding [*in*  (io/reader (:out tail))
          *out* (io/writer (:in cat-and-grep))]
  (loop []
    (when-let [x (read-line)]
      (println x)
      (recur))))
```

Another solution is to let bash handle the pipes by shelling out with `bash -c`.

## Differences with `clojure.java.shell/sh`

If `clojure.java.shell` works for your purposes, keep using it. But there are
contexts in which you need more flexibility. The major differences compared with
this library:

- `sh` is blocking, `process` makes blocking explicit via `deref`
- `sh` focuses on convenience but limits what you can do with the underlying
  process, `process` exposes as much as possible while still offering an ergonomic
  API
- `process` supports piping processes via `->` or `pipeline`
- `sh` offers integration with `clojure.java.io/copy` for `:in`, `process` extends
  this to `:out` and `:err`

###Script termination

Because `process` spawns threads for non-blocking I/O, you might have to run
`(shutdown-agents)` at the end of your Clojure JVM scripts to force
termination. Babashka does this automatically.

## Clojure.pprint

When pretty-printing a process, by default you will get an exception:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [process]])
nil
user=> (require '[clojure.pprint :as pprint])
nil
user=> (pprint/pprint (process "ls"))
Execution error (IllegalArgumentException) at user/eval257 (REPL:1).
Multiple methods in multimethod 'simple-dispatch' match dispatch value: class babashka.process.Process -> interface clojure.lang.IDeref and interface clojure.lang.IPersistentMap, and neither is preferred
```

The reason is that a process is both a record and a `clojure.lang.IDeref` and
pprint does not have a preference for how to print this. The recommended solution is to require the `babashka.process.pprint` namespace, which will define a `pprint` implementation for a `Process` record:
```clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process.pprint])
nil

user=> (pprint/pprint (process "ls"))
{:proc
 #object[java.lang.ProcessImpl 0x1d61a348 "Process[pid=43771, exitValue=\"not exited\"]"],
 :exit nil,
...
```

### Promesa

You can combine this library with [promesa](https://github.com/funcool/promesa)
in the following way. This requires `:exit-fn` which was released in version
`0.2.10`.

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :as proc]
         '[promesa.core :as prom])

(defn process
  "Returns promise that will be resolved upon process termination. The promise is rejected when the exit code is non-zero."
  [opts & cmd]
  (prom/create
   (fn [resolve reject]
     (let [exit-fn (fn [response]
                     (let [{:keys [exit] :as r} response]
                       (if (zero? exit)
                         (resolve r)
                         (reject r))))]
       (apply proc/process (assoc opts :exit-fn exit-fn) cmd)))))

(prom/let [ls (process
               {:out :string
                :err :inherit}
               "ls")
           ls-out (:out ls)]
  (prn ls-out))
```
