Clojure library for shelling out / spawning subprocesses.

## API

In 90% of the use cases you will probably need `shell` and for the remaining use
cases you will probably need a combination of `process` and `check`. Start
reading the docs for those, skim over the rest and revisit the remaining functions when you need them.

See [API docs](API.md) as generated by quickdoc.

## Installation

This library is included in [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
since
[0.2.3](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v023-2020-10-21)
but is also intended as a JVM library:

``` clojure
$ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {babashka/process {:mvn/version "0.3.11"}}}'

user=> (require '[clojure.string :as str])
nil
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [shell sh process check]])
nil
user=> (shell "ls -la")
total 144
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff    704 Dec  4 13:39 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 75 borkdude  staff   2400 Dec  3 14:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  4 borkdude  staff    128 Mar 10  2022 .circleci
drwxr-xr-x@  5 borkdude  staff    160 Mar 10  2022 .clj-kondo
drwxr-xr-x@ 50 borkdude  staff   1600 Dec  3 20:55 .cpcache
...
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 136776"
```

## Usage

``` clojure
user=> (require '[babashka.process :refer [process check sh pipeline pb]])
```

### shell

Most commonly you will use `shell`. It executes a command and streams the output
to stdout and stderr while the process is running:

``` clojure
user=> (shell "ls -la")
total 144
drwxr-xr-x@ 22 borkdude  staff    704 Dec  4 13:39 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 75 borkdude  staff   2400 Dec  3 14:18 ..
drwxr-xr-x@  4 borkdude  staff    128 Mar 10  2022 .circleci
drwxr-xr-x@  5 borkdude  staff    160 Mar 10  2022 .clj-kondo
drwxr-xr-x@ 50 borkdude  staff   1600 Dec  3 20:55 .cpcache
```

The `shell` function also checks the exit code and throws if it is non-zero:

``` clojure
user=> (shell "sl")
Execution error (IOException) at java.lang.ProcessImpl/forkAndExec (ProcessImpl.java:-2).
error=2, No such file or directory
```

To collect output as a `:string`, use the `:out :string` option as the first argument:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 144"
```

To change the working directory, use the `:dir` option:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string :dir "src/babashka"} "ls -la") :out str/split-lines first)
"total 48"
```

To add environment variables, use `:extra-env`:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (shell {:out :string :extra-env {"FOO" "BAR"}} "bb -e '(System/getenv \"FOO\")'") :out print)
"BAR"
```

### process

The `shell` function is a combination of `process` and `deref` and `check`. The
process function is for lower level usage and requires more configuration than
`shell`. Use `process` 

The return value of `process` implements `clojure.lang.IDeref`. When
dereferenced, it will wait for the process to finish and will add the `:exit` value:

``` clojure
user=> (-> @(process '[ls foo]) :exit)
1
```

The function `check` takes a process, waits for it to finish and returns it. When
the exit code is non-zero, it will throw.

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process '[ls foo]) check :out slurp)
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at babashka.process/check (process.clj:74).
ls: foo: No such file or directory
```



Both `:in`, `:out` may contain objects that are compatible with `clojure.java.io/copy`:

``` clojure
user=> (with-out-str (check (process '[cat] {:in "foo" :out *out*})))
"foo"

user=> (with-out-str (check (process '[ls] {:out *out*})))
"LICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nsrc\ntest\n"
```

The `:out` option also supports `:string`. You will need to `deref` the process
in order for the string to be there:

``` clojure
user=> (-> @(process '[ls] {:out :string}) :out)
"LICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nsrc\ntest\n"
```

Redirect output stream from one process to input stream of the next process:

``` clojure
user=> (let [is (-> (process '[ls]) :out)]
         @(process ["cat"] {:in is
                            :out :inherit})
         nil)
LICENSE
README.md
deps.edn
src
test
nil
```

Forwarding the output of a process as the input of another process can also be done with thread-first:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process '[ls])
           (process '[grep "README"]) :out slurp)
"README.md\n"
```

## Redirecting output to a file

To write to a file use `:out :write` and set `:out-file` to a file:

``` clojure
user=> (require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
nil
user=> (do @(p/process ["ls"] {:out :write :out-file (io/file "/tmp/out.txt")}) nil)
nil
user=> (slurp "/tmp/out.txt")
"CHANGELOG.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nproject.clj\nscript\nsrc\ntest\n"
```

To append to a file, use `:out :append`:

``` clojure
user=> (do @(p/process ["ls"] {:out :append :out-file (io/file "/tmp/out.txt")}) nil)
nil
user=> (slurp "/tmp/out.txt")
"CHANGELOG.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nproject.clj\nscript\nsrc\ntest\nCHANGELOG.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nproject.clj\nscript\nsrc\ntest\n"
```

## Feeding input

Here is an example of a `cat` process to which we send input while the process
is running, then close stdin and read the output of cat afterwards:

``` clojure
(ns cat-demo
  (:require [babashka.process :refer [process]]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(def catp (process '[cat]))

(.isAlive (:proc catp)) ;; true

(def stdin (io/writer (:in catp)))

(binding [*out* stdin]
  (println "hello"))

(.close stdin)

(slurp (:out catp)) ;; "hello\n"

(def exit (:exit @catp)) ;; 0

(.isAlive (:proc catp)) ;; false
```

## Processing output

Here is an example where we read the output of `yes` line by line and print it ourselves:

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :as p :refer [process]]
         '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(def yes (process ["yes"] {:err :inherit
                           :shutdown p/destroy}))

(with-open [rdr (io/reader (:out yes))]
  (binding [*in* rdr]
    (loop []
      (let [line (read-line)]
        (println :line line))
      (recur))))
```

## Printing command

We can use `:pre-start-fn` to report commands being run:

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :refer [process]])

(doseq [file ["LICENSE" "CHANGELOG.md"]]
         (-> (process ["head" "-1" file] {:out :string 
                                           :pre-start-fn #(apply println "Running" (:cmd %))})
             deref :out println))

## sh

`$` is a convenience macro around `process`:

``` clojure
user=> (def config {:output {:format :edn}})
#'user/config
user=> (-> ($ clj-kondo --config ~config --lint "src") deref :out slurp edn/read-string)
{:findings [], :summary {:error 0, :warning 0, :info 0, :type :summary, :duration 34}}
```

`sh` is a convenience function around `process` which sets `:out` and `:err` to
`:string` and blocks automatically, similar to `clojure.java.shell/sh`:

``` clojure
user=> (def config {:output {:format :edn}})
#'user/config
user=> (-> (sh ["clj-kondo" "--lint" "src"]) :out slurp edn/read-string)
{:findings [], :summary {:error 0, :warning 0, :info 0, :type :summary, :duration 34}}
```

## Tokenization

Both `process` and `sh` support tokenization when passed a single string argument:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (sh "echo hello there") :out)
"hello there\n"
```

``` clojure
user=> (-> (sh "clj-kondo --lint -" {:in "(inc)"}) :out print)
<stdin>:1:1: error: clojure.core/inc is called with 0 args but expects 1
linting took 11ms, errors: 1, warnings: 0
```

## Output buffering

Note that `check` will wait for the process to end in order to check the exit
code. When the process has lots of data to write to stdout, it is recommended to
add an explicit `:out` option to prevent deadlock due to buffering. This example
will deadlock because the process is buffering the output stream but it's not
being consumed, so the process won't be able to finish:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process ["cat"] {:in (slurp "https://datahub.io/datahq/1mb-test/r/1mb-test.csv")}) check :out slurp count)
```

The way to deal with this is providing an explicit `:out` option so the process
can finish writing its output:

``` clojure
user=> (-> (process ["cat"] {:in (slurp "https://datahub.io/datahq/1mb-test/r/1mb-test.csv") :out :string}) check :out count)
1043005
```

## Add Environment

The `:env` option replaces your entire environment with the provided map. To add environment variables you can use `:extra-env` instead:

```clojure
:extra-env {"FOO" "BAR"}
```

> **Windows TIP**: Unlike in the CMD and Powershell shells, environment variable names are case sensitive for `:extra-env`.
For example, `"PATH"` will not update the value of `"Path"` on Windows.
Here's an [example of a babashka task](https://github.com/babashka/fs/blob/3b8010d1a0db166771ac7f47573ea09ed45abe33/bb.edn#L10-L11) that understands this nuance.

## Pipelines

The `pipeline` function returns a
[`sequential`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/sequential?)
of processes from a process that was created with `->` or by passing multiple
objects created with `pb`:

``` clojure
user=> (mapv :cmd (pipeline (-> (process '[ls]) (process '[cat]))))
[["ls"] ["cat"]]
user=> (mapv :cmd (pipeline (pb '[ls]) (pb '[cat])))
[["ls"] ["cat"]]
```

To obtain the right-most process from the pipeline, use `last` (or `peek`):

``` clojure
user=> (-> (pipeline (pb ["ls"]) (pb ["cat"])) last :out slurp)
"LICENSE\nREADME.md\ndeps.edn\nsrc\ntest\n"
```

Calling `pipeline` on the right-most process returns the pipeline:

``` clojure
user=> (def p (pipeline (pb ["ls"]) (pb ["cat"])))
#'user/p
user=> (= p (pipeline (last p)))
true
```

To check an entire pipeline for non-zero exit codes, you can use:

``` clojure
user=> (run! check (pipeline (-> (process '[ls "foo"]) (process '[cat]))))
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at babashka.process/check (process.clj:37).
ls: foo: No such file or directory
```

Although you can create pipelines with `->`, for some applications it may be
preferable to create a pipeline with `pipeline` which defers to
`ProcessBuilder/startPipeline`. In the following case it takes a long time
before you would see any output due to buffering.

``` clojure
(future
  (loop []
    (spit "log.txt" (str (rand-int 10) "\n") :append true)
    (Thread/sleep 10)
    (recur)))

(-> (process '[tail -f "log.txt"])
    (process '[cat])
    (process '[grep "5"] {:out :inherit}))
```

The solution then it to use `pipeline` + `pb`:

``` clojure
(pipeline (pb '[tail -f "log.txt"])
          (pb '[cat])
          (pb '[grep "5"] {:out :inherit}))
```

The varargs arity of `pipeline` is only available in JDK9 or higher due to the
availability of `ProcessBuilder/startPipeline`. If you are on JDK8 or lower, the
following solution that reads the output of `tail` line by line may work for
you:

``` clojure
(def tail (process '[tail -f "log.txt"] {:err :inherit}))

(def cat-and-grep
  (-> (process '[cat]      {:err :inherit})
      (process '[grep "5"] {:out :inherit
                            :err :inherit})))

(binding [*in*  (io/reader (:out tail))
          *out* (io/writer (:in cat-and-grep))]
  (loop []
    (when-let [x (read-line)]
      (println x)
      (recur))))
```

Another solution is to let bash handle the pipes by shelling out with `bash -c`.

## Notes

### Differences with `clojure.java.shell/sh`

If `clojure.java.shell` works for your purposes, keep using it. But there are
contexts in which you need more flexibility. The major differences compared with
this library:

- `sh` is blocking, `process` makes blocking explicit via `deref`
- `sh` focuses on convenience but limits what you can do with the underlying
  process, `process` exposes as much as possible while still offering an ergonomic
  API
- `process` supports piping processes via `->` or `pipeline`
- `sh` offers integration with `clojure.java.io/copy` for `:in`, `process` extends
  this to `:out` and `:err`



### Script termination

Because `process` spawns threads for non-blocking I/O, you might have to run
`(shutdown-agents)` at the end of your Clojure JVM scripts to force
termination. Babashka does this automatically.

### Clojure.pprint

When pretty-printing a process, by default you will get an exception:

``` clojure
(require '[clojure.pprint :as pprint])
(pprint/pprint (process ["ls"]))
Execution error (IllegalArgumentException) at user/eval257 (REPL:1).
Multiple methods in multimethod 'simple-dispatch' match dispatch value: class babashka.process.Process -> interface clojure.lang.IDeref and interface clojure.lang.IPersistentMap, and neither is preferred
```

The reason is that a process is both a record and a `clojure.lang.IDeref` and
pprint does not have a preference for how to print this. Two potential resolutions for this are:
- require the `babashka.process.pprint` namespace, which will define a `pprint` implementation for a `Process` record:
```clojure
(require '[babashka.process.pprint]
         '[clojure.pprint :as pprint])

(pprint/pprint (process ["ls"]))

=> {:proc
    #object[java.lang.ProcessImpl...]
    ...
    }
```
- define a preference for `pprint`'s dispatch mulitmethod:

``` clojure
(prefer-method pprint/simple-dispatch clojure.lang.IPersistentMap clojure.lang.IDeref)
```

### Promesa

You can combine this library with [promesa](https://github.com/funcool/promesa)
in the following way. This requires `:exit-fn` which was released in version
`0.2.10`.

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.process :as proc]
         '[promesa.core :as prom])

(defn process
  "Returns promise that will be resolved upon process termination. The promise is rejected when the exit code is non-zero."
  [cmd opts]
  (prom/create
   (fn [resolve reject]
     (let [exit-fn (fn [response]
                     (let [{:keys [exit] :as r} response]
                       (if (zero? exit)
                         (resolve r)
                         (reject r))))]
       (proc/process cmd (assoc opts :exit-fn exit-fn))))))

(prom/let [ls (process "ls" {:out :string
                             :err :inherit})
           ls-out (:out ls)]
  (prn ls-out))
```
